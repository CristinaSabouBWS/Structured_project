# Write a python program that takes 2 args as input (look that up how to do). The args should be file paths. 
# The program should emulate the cp command (without support for any flags). 
# That means that the program should copy the contents of the first input file over to the second if possible. 
# It should print an error if any of the arguments is missing or inaccessible.
# Command example
# python custom_copy.py /tmp/demo.txt ~/demo.txt
# Bear in mind the files can be large, or even binary. It should work with any file type. It should not exceed 512 MB of RAM
# This task may seem daunting, but it's not.
# The basic idea is to try to open the input file, read it in batches of a fixed buffer size, and 
# before reading the next batch, write it to the output file, while keeping both file descriptors open.
# The last requirement is simply to discourage you from trying to fully load the input file in memory
# Reading line by line may seem like a good idea, but non-text files  (photos, videos, programs, etc) usually don't have that. 
# Even text files offer no guarantees that the text isn't on one line.
